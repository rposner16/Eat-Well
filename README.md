# Search for recipes and restaurants

I created this project for Thinkful. It allows the user to choose between searching for possible recipes to make or restaurants in their area, and it uses the Edamam (for recipes) and Zomato (for restaurants) APIs. In order to run the app, you need API keys, which are in a separate file (apiKeys.js) that I had Git ignore so that the keys aren't compromised.
