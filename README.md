# Search for recipes and restaurants

I created this project for Thinkful. It allows the user to choose between searching for possible recipes to make or restaurants in their area, and it uses the Edamam (for recipes) and Zomato (for restaurants) APIs. Currently, to run the app, you need to insert actual values for API keys in the lines in index.js where it says "INSERT [blank] API KEY HERE." I'm hoping to find a more effective way of dealing with this without compromising my API keys soon.
