# Eat Well

<a href="https://rposner16.github.io/api-capstone/" target="_blank">Link to Eat Well app on GitHub pages</a>

This app was my API Capstone project for Thinkful. It allows the user to choose between searching for possible recipes to make or restaurants in their area.  It uses the Edamam (for recipes) and Zomato (for restaurants) APIs.  For the recipe section, simply enter the name of an ingredient or food category, and for the restaurant section, enter the name of your city and choose from the list of results to find the correct one.  Both sections of the app allow you to change the number of results that you receive.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Zomato API, Edamam API
